# Project Name

**Author**: Ameilia Valdes & Simon Panek

**Version**: 1.0.1 

## Overview
This app pulls in location data and weather data for a given city from other API's and displays them for the user.

## Getting Started
If the app is run in the web browser no additional local resources will be required.
